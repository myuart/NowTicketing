# NowTicketing

This is an iOS mobile app for buying transit tickets quickly.
Just 3-steps to buy tickets:
1. Selct a rider type, Adult, Child or Senior.
2. Select a fare, 2.5 Hour Ticket, 1 Day Pass or 30 Day Pass.
3. Set the number of tickets to buy and confirm.

In terms of implementation, the app contains 3 UIs, namely the RiderTableViewController, FareTableViewController, and PurchaseViewController.
Unit tests are included for testing the logic in these 3 controllers.
